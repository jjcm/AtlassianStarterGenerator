Our mission is simple: get humanity off the ground and move technology forward by exploring the universe around us.\nOn your first day, you‚Äôll get to know all the details of our business goals and outlook. You‚Äôll settle into your new home (or pod!) and start learning how to contribute to what we think is the most important frontier.\nThis wiki contains all the information you‚Äôll need to get started on the team. And, we look forward to seeing where we go, together."

It‚Äôs up to each of us to follow up on outdated documentation. If you see something, say something!\nThe fourth generation T-45 rocket, associated modules, and launch systems are frozen. Additional scope and defect prevention will be evaluated by Jen on a per request basis. You can ping her on Stride or send a request in our Program Management service desk."

We can prevent death by a thousand paper cuts, if we all chip in.\nDon‚Äôt be afraid to speak up if your estimates are off, if your component is failing, if your builds are red, if your head is a little out of sorts.\nHere‚Äôs our defect process in a nutshell:\nWhen you identify a defect, check the priority matrix to see how seriously it needs to be addressed.\nIf your defect is a blocker for deployment or readjusts the coordinated schedule, raise a ticket in your respective project and notify the program management group.\nAssign yourself as the major point of contact.\nPrepare a defect summary for the program management group.\nTake a short break and remember that we‚Äôre in this together. Defects aren‚Äôt your fault!"

That‚Äôs 365 days without another ‚Äúincident‚Äù.\nFingers crossed, we all learned something that day. We all learned that ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà can ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà without much ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà to slow them down. After ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, I‚Äôm fairly certain that ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ran aground on the launch site and ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà learned to pick up the slack.\nBut, mostly, I think we all learned a little about ourselves.\nFor reasons that should be obvious (see ‚ÄúDecision: We never speak of the incident again‚Äù), much of this blog post has been redacted.\nIf you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll be looking forward to another 365 days without another ‚Äúincident‚Äù. We hope."

Elon‚Äôs at it again.\nI think it‚Äôs important that we remember that Space X isn‚Äôt really much competition for us. They‚Äôre focused on privatized launches with minimal cargo load. We‚Äôre thinking lightyears ahead of them. (Get it? Light years‚Ä¶)\nAt any rate, James is preparing a response to Elon‚Äôs comments as we speak. And our launch is looking bigger and more exciting!\nCheck out the tweeters to see what I mean\n"
